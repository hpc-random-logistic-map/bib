    annote    = {Willibeek-LeMair and Reeves discuss five strategies for dynamic load balancing: sender initiated diffusion, receiver initiated diffusion, hierarchical balancing model, gradient model, and dimension exchange method. The authors consider tasks such as:  processor load evaluation, load balancing profitability, task migration, and task selection. Given the trade off between accuracy and increased time for communication, they conclude that the receiver initiated diffusion (RID) is the best method for dynamically load balancing. It is the method that scales the best with the number of processors and requires the least amount of communication overhead. Dynamic load balancing is key for solving systems whose solutions are defined recursively, such as a fixed point iteration. We will use the findings of this paper to guide our program design such that it is the best suited for RID.}

This paper serves as a theoretical underpinning for our simulation, and also as a reference for the set-valued bifurcation diagram we plan to generate.}
